## Overview
Yet easy but powerful [Frida](https://frida.re) module to create custom floating menu on Android.

## Features
* Frida Integration: no need to compile the code and then inject it every time as you did with a completely Java menu
* Zero-knowledge about JNI: this project uses frida's convenient api instead of JNI
* Ready-to-use wrappers: even if you donâ€™t know anything about Java, the project already includes wrappers for the API with minimal jsdoc
* Highly customizable: ready-made layouts/configs available or create your own

## Usage
Please refer to wiki page.

## Troubleshooting
Through a very unstable Java bridge (on which this works), we cannot guarantee that everything will work. Please, prefer roms with non/slightly modified ART code (AOSP forks mainly)<br>***MIUI, ColorOS and other OEM roms MAY work incorrect or won't work at all***
