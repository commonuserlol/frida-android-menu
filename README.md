Easily create graphical user interface for android with frida<br>
![Gif](https://i.imgur.com/HF9oIm2.mp4)

# Supported roms
Should work with (almost) pure **aosp** like LineageOS and PixelExperience based roms<br>
Work is **NOT GUARANTEED** for MIUI, EMUI, RUI and other OEM-modded roms<br>
If you see an error on such roms, then create an issue with a clear description, firmware name, android version, etc. (just fill out the template :))
