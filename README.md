# frida-java-menu
Easily create graphical user interface for android with frida<br>
[**Get started**](https://github.com/commonuserlol/frida-java-menu/wiki/Examples)
## Why i should use it?
Well, that was expected.
* Not providing any dependencies (i.e. you wont care about .dex or .so files loading)
* Completely ts (there is good typing)
* Convenient API with wrappers
* Easy to customize (no need to recompile anything except the script)
* No need to care about jni stuff
* Easy protect from thieves, just compile and obfuscate
* I haven't come up with other reasons yet

# Supported roms
Should work with (almost) pure **AOSP** like LineageOS and PixelExperience based roms<br>
Work is **NOT GUARANTEED** for MIUI, EMUI, RUI and other OEM-modded roms<br>
Mainly because I donâ€™t have devices with these firmwares for testing (so if you have them and can test, please create an issue with confirmation/error)
